**A modern approach to designing and implementing scalable microservices platforms with NATS messaging**

## What is this book about?
Building a scalable microservices platform that caters to business demands is critical to the success of that platform. In a microservices architecture, inter-service communication becomes a bottleneck when the platform scales. This book provides a reference architecture along with a practical example of how to implement it for building microservices-based platforms with NATS as the messaging backbone for inter-service communication.In Designing Microservices Platforms with NATS, you’ll learn how to build a scalable and manageable microservices platform with NATS. . 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the concepts of microservices architecture
* Get to grips with NATS messaging technology
* Handle transactions and message delivery guarantees with microservices
* Implement a reference architecture for microservices using NATS
* Discover how to improve the platform’s security and observability
* Explore how a NATS microservices platform integrates with an enterprise ecosystem

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
func main() {
    // Initialize TracinginitTracing()
       initTracing()     
	}

```
